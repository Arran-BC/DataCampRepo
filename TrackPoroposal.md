TABLEAU TRACK PROPOSAL - Intro to Dynamic Dashboards in Tableau

1: Creating Dashboards in Tableau (Refresher) (From DataCamp)

Dashboards allow users to interrogate and shape their data in the way that best suits them and their audience. They provide some of the most comprehensive data visualisations available today and can be a major force in driving business decisions on multiple scales.

Having completed this course you will be able to apply the fundamental best practices of Tableau development to any of your dashboards, and will be able to apply filters and actions to your reports where required in order to broaden the functionality of the dashboard.

2: An Introduction to Calculated Fields

While predominantly a visualisation tool, Tableau is also proficient in data querying and manipulation. Calculated fields allow users to manipulate, filter, aggregate, and calculate new and relevant data on the fly, streamlining the build of their dashboards and reducing the need to restructure or directly query any data sources.

Upon completion, you will be able to generate new, dynamic fields within any dataset connected to Tableau, and be able to visualise these in comparison to non-calculated fields. You will also be able to apply your understanding of Tableau’s ‘Order of Operations’ and understand what calculations can be applied to what data.

3: Tableau Parameters

Parameters take calculated fields a step further, allowing users to specify data both within and without their datasets which can then be used to improve and personalise the views available in a dashboard. Parameters can also underpin some key practices behind improving the dynamic structure of dashboards, and allow users to personalise and improve interactions with their dashboards.

Once completed, you will be able to generate Tableau parameters in a variety of styles and incorporate them into dashboard actions, as well as use parameters to influence the value of calculated fields and the dashboards they influence. 

4: Advanced Actions and Tableau Formatting

Tableau dashboards are able to offer a wide variety of views and displays depending on the interactions users take with each view. Dashboards can display and hide data on request, as well as provide users with unique and interactive ways to interrogate their data at different levels, allowing for more coherent storytelling within each dashboard and improved business impact as a result.

This course will encourage you to try out and implement different action styles within a template dashboard. You will also be able to display and hide sheets in a dashboard based on parameter entries and actions, while being encouraged to interact creatively with the data provided. You will also be able to implement actions on subsequent views that appear and disappear based on selected actions and parameters.

5: Case Study - Build a Dynamic Dashboard

Practice makes perfect. We’ve provided you with a short business case and a dataset that we think you’ll really enjoy working with. You’re tasked with working on a dynamic report to present to senior management. It’s crucial for them to be able to interact with the dashboard in a variety of ways, and to understand the story of the data from high level to a more granular view. 

You will be able to make the graphs you show function in a variety of ways depending on actions and parameters, and also build a real narrative into the dashboard. We’re excited to see what you can do!
