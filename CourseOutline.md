Sketch Course Outline - An Introduction to Calculated Fields

CHAPTER 1 - Basic Calculations

Lesson 1 - Row-Level Calculations
Learner will be able to transform and generate row values based on a few key functions (IIF, IF, Substring, DateTrunc)

Lesson 2 - Aggregate Calculations
Learner will be able to summarise data into aggregate values across multiple views and aggregation levels (Sum, Avg, Count, CountD)

CHAPTER 2 - Level Of Detail Calculations

Lesson 3 - Tableau Order of Operations
Learner will be able to distinguish what LOD calculations can be applied to what data 

Lesson 4 - LOD Calculations and Granularity
Learner will be able to produce LOD calculations of varying granularity across a give dataset and understand what each one achieves.

CHAPTER 3 - Table Calculations

Lesson 5 - Understanding the use of Table Calculations
Learner will be able to examine data sources and identify potential uses of table calculations across data visualisations. 

Lesson 6 - Applying Table Calculations
Learner will be able to produce multiple table calculations on sample datasets.

CHAPTER 4 - Application of Calculated Fields (Example Dataset)

Lesson 7 - Experiment with Calculated Fields
Learner will be able to apply what they have learned so far to manipulate a test dataset in a number of ways and to provide analytical insight.

Lesson 8 - Calculated Fields Business Case
Learner will be able to show the use of basic calculations, LODs, and table calculations for use within an example business case with defined outcome requirements.
